Penalizing Top Performers: Conservative Loss for Semantic Segmentation Adaptation

This is a repo for showing the implementation of the paper at above. The working version is under the dev branch.

Google Drive Dataset Link : https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1FnQxkIrkhf5MNTJO2mkjQJoZ48tCpHie?usp=sharing

Google Colab Notebook Link : https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1iaZ8P2qclwG_jO7GVOdWUsJax-MXzxI6?usp=sharing

For this repository to create output, shared google drive should be added to implementer's drive and colab notebook should be executed.

When the training start, the code will start to save the results and the models to /content/gdrive/MyDrive/AI_PROJECT(BLG_527E)/fcn8vgg16_output/runs directory This directory can be changed in utils/logger.py While we are working on this project, we changed it a lot. Our different experiments can be found in /content/gdrive/MyDrive/AI_PROJECT(BLG_527E)/fcn8vgg16_output directory AFTER TRAINING DONE, THE RESULTS THAT WE SHOWED IN THE PRESENTATION WILL BE IN THE /content/gdrive/MyDrive/AI_PROJECT(BLG_527E)/fcn8vgg16_output/runs/images/fcn8_vgg16/gta5 directory
